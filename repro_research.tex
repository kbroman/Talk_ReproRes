    By ``reproducible research,'' I'm referring to ``computational
    reproducibility,'' by which I mean that the data and code for a
    project are packaged together in a way that they can be handed to
    someone else, who can rerun the code and get the same
    results---the same figures and tables. This is surprisingly hard
    to do, and it's even more difficult in the context of a
    collaboration between two or more data analysts.

 Karl -- this is very interesting,
 however you used an old version of
 the data (n=143 rather than n=226).

 I'm really sorry you did all that
 work on the incomplete dataset.

\note{I'm an applied statistician; my goal is to help people make
  sense of their data. I have a lot of collaborators, and there's
  nothing I enjoy more than puzzling over their data. So I write a lot of
  reports, describing what I've done and what I've learned.

  This is an email I got from a collaborator,
  in response to an analysis report that I had sent him.
  It's always a bit of a shock to get an email like this: what have I
  done? Why am I working with the wrong data, and where is the right data?

  But what he didn't know is that by this point in my life, I'd
  adopted a reproducible workflow.
  Because I'd set things up carefully, I could just substitute in the
  newer dataset, type a single command (``{\tt make}'') to rerun the
  analyses, and get the revised report.

  This is a reproducibility success story. We all make mistakes, but
  if our projects are reproducible, we can nimbly recover from those
  mistakes.

  There is a second important lesson here: At the start of such
  reports, I always include a paragraph about our shared goals, along
  with some brief data summaries. By doing so, he immediately saw that
  I had an old version of the data. If I hadn't done so, we might
  never have discovered my error.

\note{Computational work is
  {\color{nhilit} reproducible} if the data and code are organized in
  a way that they can be handed to someone else, who can rerun the
  code and get the same results---the same figures and tables.
  {\color{nhilit} Replicable} is more stringent: can
  someone repeat the experiment and get the same results?

  Reproducibility is a minimal standard. That something is
  reproducible doesn't imply that it is correct. The code may have bugs. The
  methods may be poorly behaved. There could be experimental
  artifacts.

  (But reproducibility is probably associated with correctness.)

  Note that some scientists say replicable for what I call
  reproducible, and vice versa.

\note{It was a long, hard process for me to move from my old standard
  practice to a fully reproducible workflow. In thinking through that
  process, I wrote down my thoughts on the basic steps to take towards
  full reproducibility. This forms the basis of what I'll present here.

\note{
  While it's good to strive for full reproducibility, it can be difficult
  to achieve. But partially reproducible is better than not-at-all
  reproducible. Similarly, making data and code partially open is
  better than nothing.

  Don't try to change every aspect of your workflow all at once. Focus
  on revising one aspect at a time. When you get to the end of a
  project, you may be dissatisfied with the state of things, but don't
  give up. Try to make each project a bit better organized and
  reproducible than the last.

  processed data.

  Write {\tt ReadMe} files to explain what's what. Make sure they stay

    \ei

  \ei

\note{
  You want the names to be easily to handle in software, which
  generally means no spaces or special characters except for
  underscore and hyphen (which are useful for separating words).

  But you want the names to explain the files' contents, so that you
  don't have to open the files to figure out what they are.

  Consistency is important: if you have a bunch of similar files, you
  should have some system for naming them.

  And make use of the computer's sort of files, by padding numbers
  with 0's (so that 10 appears after 9 rather than before 2) and
  organizing the files into groups.

  Dates should always be written as `YYYY-MM-DD`, so that when sorted
  they are in order by date.

\note{

    {\tt final{\textunderscore}rev2}, and
    {\tt final{\textunderscore}old}.

    Another problem here is that the files aren't organized very well.

    Never do calculations in your raw data file. If you're doing

  \note{
    Clear metadata is critical for others to be able to understand

    to have short and longer versions of the names for use in data
    visualizations, as the column names themselves can be cryptic.

    These metadata are data, and so rather than make a Word

    than positions of columns (or rows).

    I once had a project where the data were in a 500-worksheet excel
    file, one sheet per subject. Each sheet had a complex layout where
    you had to pick out various values from different places. And the

  \note{
    Another important step towards reproducibility is to revise your
    code to make it more clear.

    The single most important step towards clear code is to pull out
    complex or repeated code as a separate function.
    This makes your code easier to read and maintain.

    Next, combine those functions together into a package or module.
    It's surprisingly easy to create an R package (see {\tt
      https://kbroman.org/pkg\_primer}) and it's even easier to make a
    Python module.

    When writing functions, try to write them in a somewhat-general
    way and then pull them out of the project as separate package or
    module, so that you (and/or others) may reuse them for other
    purposes.

    \ei

  \note{
    We all struggle to keep track of versions of things.

    Shared drives (like google drive, dropbox, and box) often keep
    track of past versions, but usually there's a time limit (like
    30 days or a year).

    You can make copies of file with a version number appended to
    the name. You might zip up a directory and include the date in the
    zipped file.

    Formal version control has a number of advantages, including easy
    of browsing the history or jumping to a particular time point.
    The ability to merge simultaneous changes from multiple users is a
    key advantage.

    git can be hard to learn; it's designed for pretty hard-core
    programmers. But there are growing learning resources, and the
    long-term payoff is considerable. For collaborative projects, the
    payoff is immediate.

  \note{
    A reproducible workflow is valuable even if you don't intend to

    But if do want to share, it's best to place things at a

    and that provides DOIs.

    Place code at GitHub (or the similar site, BitBucket). The only problem
    is that it can't necessarily be trusted to still be there 5 years from now.
    There's an easy way to have ``releases'' archived at zenodo.org
    automatically, with a DOI. So I recommend that.

    For data, it's probably best to use a domain-specific repository,
    if there is an appropriate one. Otherwise, general repositories
    github, figshare, zenodo, or datadryad. Again, github is not ideal

\note{
  It can be hard to keep in sync across groups in a multi-site
  project. If a problem is discovered and some aspect of data
  preprocessing needs to be redone, will this get communicated to all
  analysis teams, so that relevant analyses get rerun as needed?

``Could you do these analyses? X said they would, but they're not
  responding to my emails.''

\end{center}

\note{
  Everyone has multiple things going on, and sometimes there is need
  for rush analyses, say for a grant submission or conference
  presentation. Is there a shared understanding of who will do what
  when, and how emergencies can be handled?

  The organization of a project often depends on the worst day you
  spent on it. If you need to do a bunch of stuff last-minute, will
  you leave the project directory in a mess, or will you clean up
  after yourself?

\note{
  Critical for a successful collaboration is that the collaborators
  have a shared vision for the project. We often maybe think about
  being in agreement on the approach to publication and co-authorship.
  But perhaps more difficult is coming to an agreement on data and
  code sharing (what, where, and when?), on who will do what, on how
  soon it will be done, and on the ongoing sharing, among collaborators,
  of detailed methods and results.

\note{
    Also important is the technology or engineering of sharing. Can
    the collaborators agree on the project structure, data and
    metadata formats, and the software environment?

    Some groups may use R and some python. This should not pose a problem.

    A key issue is how to keep the multiple groups' work in sync. It
    is best that this can be done automatically. Experience
    demonstrates that if synchronization approach requires some manual
    steps, they will not be done consistently.

\note{
  I must admit to not being totally confident about what advice to
  give, regarding the tools to use for sharing data and code among
  collaborators.

  For sharing data, simple options include posting large files on a
  data repository like figshare, or using cloud drive like dropbox,
  box, or google drive.

  For sharing code, I prefer to use a version control system like git,
  with github, bitbucket, or a locally-managed equivalent.

  For sharing the analysis pipeline or workflow, one can
  incorporate a system like make (or drake, snakemake, or rake) with
  the code.

  The full software environment could be replicated across teams using
  docker containers. Binder and Whole Tale are two systems for making
  this easier.

\note{
  I've long felt that the key need, in getting computational
  scientists to adopt a reproducible workflow, is training. For the
  most part, all of the software tools are available, but many people
  haven't incorporated them into their daily work.
